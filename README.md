# Oslo 2023: lulu seminar

post-clustering curation of metabarcoding data with [lulu](https://github.com/tobiasgf/lulu)

To install lulu and to reproduce the results, simply run the `.Rmd`
file with [RStudio/Posit](https://posit.co/) or
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (using the package
`poly-R`).

## Roadmap

- [x] start with a simple test showing what `lulu` does,
- [x] add more complex tests,
- [x] demonstrate limits,
- [ ] link [BIO9905MERG1_V23](https://github.com/krabberod/BIO9905MERG1_V23) to this repository
